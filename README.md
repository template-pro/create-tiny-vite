# Create-tiny-vite

## Why

`vite` is an excellent tool that provides a lot of templates, although the official template provided has been streamlined enough, but I still want to be less, so I forked a copy of it, just to trim the official existing template and remove some non-essential files. i ❤️ vite.

## Usage

As with the official documentation, you just need to replace the `vite` keyword with `tiny-vite`.

With NPM:

```bash
npm create tiny-vite@latest
```

With Yarn:

```bash
yarn create tiny-vite
```

With PNPM:

```bash
pnpm create tiny-vite
```

Other and official remain the same, enjoy!
